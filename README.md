  <h1>Skills-based browser agent</h1>
  <p>
    <em>
      Runtime allows you to interact with a wide range of <strong>Chromium-based</strong> browsers, including <strong>Chrome</strong>, <strong>Edge</strong> and soon (Firefox, Brave, Dia, Comet, etc). Our goal is to provide a fast, reliable, and affordable way to work with your office tools and the web. No need to install a separate AI browser to access AI capabilities.
    </em>

  <p><em>No vendor lock-in or API dependencies.</em></p>

<summary> What is our skills method? </summary>

Previous AI browser agents (such as Comet, Dia, Genspark, browser-use, or browserbase) rely heavily on the DOM at execution time and manipulate it using heuristic methods. This approach makes processing requests slow.

We took a different approach: instead of manipulating the DOM at runtime/render-time, we use the tag attributes present in the DOM after the initial rendering by Blink. These attributes serve as gateways to locate elements such as `button`, `a`, `div`, `span`, and others.

We call these "skills." Every website has a set of predefined actions that a human can perform. For example, on amazon.com, the basic functions a user might perform include:  
 - searching for products, 
 - reading product information (such as title, price, discount, delivery time, rating, comments, etc.), 
 - adding items to the cart, 
 - viewing the cart, 
 - tracking deliveries, 
 - and more.

By leveraging predefined skills instead of interacting with the live DOM, we achieve significant speed improvements. This approach also removes the need for the LLM to reason about which button to click or which element to hover over. 

Important: While we recognize that this method is not infinitely scalable, we have developed a solution to address scalability challenges and will be sharing more details soon. Follow us for updates!

A single skills of amazon.* are:

```json
{
    "name": "search_products",
    "description": "Search for a product on Amazon. this skill will take the user query as input, and perform the search on amazon.com and it will return the list of results of products.",
    "input":  { "text": "string" },
    "output": "results",
    "steps": [
    { "action": "navigate_to_url", "url": "https://www.amazon.com" },
    { "action": "wait_for_selector", "selector": "#twotabsearchtextbox" },
    { "action": "click",              "selector": "#twotabsearchtextbox" },
    { "action": "type",               "selector": "#twotabsearchtextbox", "input_key": "text" },
    { "action": "press_enter" },
    { "action": "wait_for_selector",  "selector": "div[data-component-type='s-search-result'][data-asin]:not([data-asin=''])" },
    { "action": "scroll_down",        "times": 3 },

        "asin": "@data-asin",
